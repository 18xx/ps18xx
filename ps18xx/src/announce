	ps18xx -- generate 18xx postscript maps and tile lists
				(c) M. Klose
----------------------------------------------------------------------

ps18xx lets you generate tile lists and maps for several 18xx style
games in the PostScript format. New tiles and tokens are laid on the
map by adding line by line to a file.

To print these maps you need a PostScript capable printer (or a
"converter" like ghostscript).
To view the maps on the screen, you need Display PostScript or a
PostScript Viewer like GSView or GhostView.

Available maps:	1825u1	- South Britain (Unit 1)
		1829n	- North Britain
		1829s	- South Britain
		1830	- NorthEast US
		1830r	- NorthEast US (Reading)
		1835	- Germany
		1837	- Austria
		1841	- North Italy
		1842	- Schleswig-Holstein (Germany)
		1847	- Pfalz (Germany)
		1849	- Sicily
		1853	- India
		1856	- Canada
		1870	- South US
		1876-30	- Trinidad (1830 variant)
		1876-35	- Trinidad (1835 variant)
		1899	- China

New in version 1.5:
      - new game: 1830r
      - renamed 1839i to 1841, renamed 1850s to 1849
      - 1853: pre-existing track is dual gauge (fix by A. Lange)
      - 1850/1853: #96, #97 have double stations
	(All following changes in this version by Steve Thomas)
      - home stations in 1841
      - new games: 1842, 1847, 1876-30, 1876-35

New in version 1.4:
      - detection of device type: color or b/w
	(All changes in this version by Steve Thomas)
      - 1825u1 (South Britain (Unit 1)) and 1899 (China) have been added.
      - some bugs fixed in 1856
      - inserted national frontiers in 1839i

New in version 1.3.1:
      - some bugs fixed in 1853 (thanks to Andy Lange)

New in version 1.3:
      - file sizes reduced
      - ports in 1829 (both boards)
      - colors for special areas (1837 Bosnia and 1853 Ganges) and
	a small border around South Tirol (1837)

	(All following changes in this version by Steve Thomas)
      - 1850s (Sicily) and 1839i (Italy) have been added.  This involves
	three new terrain types - ports, alpine passes, and appennine
	passes - and appennine and alpine track.
      - Support for impassable hexsides has been added.  The 1830, 1835,
	and 1870 maps now take advantage of this feature, as well as the
	new 1839i and 1850s maps.
      - Support for tiles "sitting" has been added.  This is used for
	the revised 1856 map, as well as the new maps.
      - Support for swapping the numerical and alphabetic axes has been
	added. This is used in the revised 1856 map.
      - The boxes for the values for off-board areas now are sized
	according to the lengths of the strings.  This improves the
	appearance of the 1856 and 1870 maps.
      - If a value is >= 100, the value circle becomes an oval.  This
	improves the appearance of the Toronto gray tile in 1856.
      - The 1870 map has had the major city names added.
      - The mechanism for printing multipage tile availability lists is
	changed to move to a new page after printing a full page.

      - 1870 (without destinations)
      - 1830-map bug fixed
      - poster code included (to print larger maps on more than one sheet)

New in version 1.1:
      - 1837, 1856 (without destinations)
