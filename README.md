ps18xx
======

Software for running 18XX email games using Matthias Klose's ps system.

This software was originally created by Matthias Klose and distributed as
"postcardware". The original license is preserved (in src/LICENSE) though all
indications are that Matthias is no longer at the given address.

This software has seen numerous contributors, but this particular copy of the
software has been heavily developed and maintained by Steve Thomas. Please
consult the included README and src/LICENSE files for contact information and
other credits.

If you are a user of the software and have any thoughts, Steve appreciates
user feedback. I find the software perfectly usable as it is and am currently
mostly interested in updating and adding modules.

Neither myself, nor Steve, nor any one else provide any warranty or guarantee
with this software. It's provided as is and you may with to read the source
code as I did before using the software. Updates/fixes may be provided in the
future, but no guarantee is made of this.

If you don't know how this system works, then you will want to digest the
ps18xx/README file which has an overview of the system. If you know what
you're doing and want to jump in to how variants are assembled, see the
accompanying VARIANTS file.
